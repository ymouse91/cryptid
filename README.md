# Cryptid Companion — Client-Side Fork

A browser-based companion app for the [Cryptid](https://ospreypublishing.com/uk/cryptid-9781472830654/) board game by Osprey Games.

This fork removes the original server dependency entirely. All game generation runs in JavaScript directly in the browser, making it deployable as a fully static site with no backend required.

## What it does

The app helps players set up and run a game of Cryptid:

- Generates a valid game setup: map layout, structure placement, clue assignments, and habitat location
- Shows each player their secret clue one at a time (pass-the-device model)
- Displays the hex map on screen
- Supports 2–5 players in both normal and advanced mode
- Reveals the habitat and all clues at the end of the game
- Generates shareable URLs so players can open their own clue on their own device (`?game=CODE&player=N`)

## Differences from the original

The original companion site at [playcryptid.com](https://www.playcryptid.com/) relies on a PHP backend that serves pre-generated game data. This fork replaces that with a client-side game generation engine written in plain JavaScript, making it possible to host on GitHub Pages or any static file host with no server-side processing.

Other changes:
- Removed dependency on `localforage` (no longer needed without server caching)
- Added a compact shareable game code system for async/remote play
- Simplified the settings UI

## How to use

Visit the hosted site, select your player count and mode, and press **Start**. Pass the device around for each player to see their clue privately. Use **Share** to generate per-player links if playing remotely.

To run locally, just open `index.html` in a browser — no build step or server required.

## PWA and offline use

The app includes a web app manifest, installable icons, and a service worker. When served over HTTPS, such as from GitHub Pages, it can be installed as a PWA and keeps the game UI, scripts, images, PDFs, and sounds available offline after the first successful load.

Deployments are handled by the GitHub Pages workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
